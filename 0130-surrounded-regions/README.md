<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/">130. Surrounded Regions</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given an <code>m x n</code> matrix <code>board</code> containing <code>'X'</code> and <code>'O'</code>, <em>capture all regions that are 4-directionally&nbsp;surrounded by</em> <code>'X'</code>.</p>

<p>A region is <strong>captured</strong> by flipping all <code>'O'</code>s into <code>'X'</code>s in that surrounded region.</p>

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/xogrid.jpg" style="width: 550px; height: 237px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.

<strong>Output:</strong> [["X"]]

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>m == board.length</code></li>
	<li><code>n == board[i].length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 200</code></li>
	<li><code>board[i][j]</code> is <code>'X'</code> or <code>'O'</code>.</li>
