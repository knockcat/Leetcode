<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-people-aware-of-a-secret/">2327. Number of People Aware of a Secret</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>On day <code>1</code>, one person discovers a secret.</p>

<p>You are given an integer <code>delay</code>, which means that each person will <strong>share</strong> the secret with a new person <strong>every day</strong>, starting from <code>delay</code> days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer <code>forget</code>, which means that each person will <strong>forget</strong> the secret <code>forget</code> days after discovering it. A person <strong>cannot</strong> share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.</p>

<p>Given an integer <code>n</code>, return<em> the number of people who know the secret at the end of day </em><code>n</code>. Since the answer may be very large, return it <strong>modulo</strong> <code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>
